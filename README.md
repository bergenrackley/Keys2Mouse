# Keys2Mouse

This is a quick and dirty attempt at creating a Windows version of croian's Mouseless application, as it currently only has a Mac build

Please support the Mouseless project, it is surely much more polished than mine.

# Installation
There is no installation process, just download the release zip and run the Keys2Mouse exe. Make sure it's in a directory you plan to keep it in before changing the RunOnStart setting to true.

# Settings
To change settings, open the System Tray and double click on the app icon. Alternatively, press "?" while the overlay is open.

# Usage
To summon the overlay, press Win + LCtrl.
Type the letters of a cell to move your mouse to the cell, and press the next key for the subgrid.
To left click, press LCtrl. To double click, hold 2 and press LCtrl. To triple click, hold 3 and press LCtrl.
To right click, press Tab.
All actions besides summoning the overlay must be performed while the overlay is open, the only HotKey the app registers is Win+LCtrl.
If the key combinations above don't seem to be working while the overlay is opened, you may have accidentally focused another window while summoning the overlay. Close the overlay with Win+LCtrl and resummon it.
